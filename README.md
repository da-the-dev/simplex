# Simplex Method
Implementation of Simplex Algorith in C++ to solve LPPs

## For collaborators
Please inspect the Git flow we use:
- `master` branch is for releases **only**.
- `develop` branch accumuales changes. If it has passesed all the tests and was inspected it can be merged into `master`.
- All the feature branches are marked with `f-<name-of-the-feature`.
- All the fix branches are marked with `x-<name-of-the-fix`.
- Fixes and feature branches merge into `develop` first.

### To compile
- Run `./make`

To run: `build/bin/simplex`

## Some instructions
1. Enter the number of variables and the number of constraints equations
2. Enter the contraint matrix C 
3. Enter the objective function coefficients A
4. Enter the "right-hand side" value b
5. Enter the approximation accuracy (same format as in `setprecision()`)
